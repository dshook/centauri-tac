Ideas for future implementation:

- Factories could have dependencies injected as well if needed. I did not need it so far, but I do not see any reason to not do it
- Constructon Injection can be implemented somehow, I did not bother. OnInject is enough for most of the cases
- Named dependencies could be important, never needed them
- The Reflection system could be improved through caching...not sure if is needed
- A scene can have already several context, but currenty they cannot be hierarchical
- The framework does not support a xml base config file, which can be done too if needed.
