Ideas for future implementation:

- Bindings should be optionally weak
- IInitialize interface can be substituted with an attribute
- Factories could have dependencies injected as well if needed. I did not need it so far, but I do not see any reason to not do it
- Constructon Injection can be implemented, sometime is useful (in order to have less class dependencies)
- Named dependencies could be important, never needed them
- A scene can have already several context, but currenty they cannot be hierarchical
- The framework does not support a xml base config file, which can be done too if needed.
